Advanced instructions,
This spreadsheet can be used to populate deployment files for any of the,
schemas in the schemas directory.  The case-insenstive name of the schema,
must be specified in the upper left corner of the table.  The table can then,
be positioned anywhere in the spreadsheet provided there is at least one row,
and column of empty space around the table.  The case-insenstive names or,
titles of the properties can be either along rows or columns (either position,
is valid).,
