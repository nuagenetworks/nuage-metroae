# Nuage Networks Metro Automation Engine
(4 minute read)  

Metro is an automation engine that deploys and upgrades Nuage Networks components.
After you specify the individual details of your target platform, Metro Automation Engine (leveraging Ansible playbooks and roles) sets up the environment as specified. Metro Automation Engine can also upgrade, roll-back, and health-check the environment.

## Supported Components for Deployment
Metro Automation Engine supports deployment of the following components as VMs on the target server. The same target server types are supported as the VSP platform.

Component | KVM (el7)<br>Stand-alone (SA) | KVM (el7)<br>Clustered (HA) | ESXi<br>Stand-alone (SA) | ESXi<br>Clustered (HA)
------- | :---: | :---: | :----: | :---:
VSD (Virtualized Services Directory) | X | X | X | X
VSTAT (Elastic Backend for statistics) | X | X | X | X
VSC (Virtualized Services Controller) | X | X | X | X
VCIN (vCenter Integration Node) | X |  | X |
VNSUTIL<br>(Virtualized Network Services-Utility) | X |  | X |

#### Supported Dataplane components (installed as package/agent):

Component |  KVM <br>(el6, el7,ubuntu 14.04/16.04) | ESXi
--------- | :----: | -------
VRS (Virtual Routing & Switching) | X | (upgrade only)
Libnetwork on VRS nodes  | X |
NSG-V (Network Services Gateway-Virtual) |  X |

#### Provided Auxiliary Services
* DNS/NTP

## Use of Ansible Playbooks and Roles
**Ansible** provides a method to easily define one or more actions to be performed on one or more computers. These tasks can target the local system Ansible is running from, as well as other systems that Ansible can reach over the network. The Ansible engine has minimal installation requirements. Python, with a few additional libraries, is all that is needed for the core engine. Metro Automation Engine includes a few custom Python modules and scripts. Agent software is not required on the hosts to be managed. Communication with target hosts defaults to SSH. Ansible does not require the use of a persistent state engine. Every Ansible run determines state as it goes, and adjusts as necessary given the action requirements. Running Ansible requires only an inventory of potential targets, state directives, either expressed as an ad hoc action, or a series coded in a YAML file, and the credentials necessary to communicate with the target.

**Playbooks** are the language by which Ansible orchestrates, configures, administers and deploys systems. They are YAML-formatted files that collect one or more plays. Plays are one or more tasks linked to the hosts that they are to be executed on.

**Roles** build on the idea of include files and combine them to form clean, reusable abstractions. Roles are ways of automatically loading certain vars files, tasks, and handlers based on a known file structure.

### Metro Automation Engine Playbooks and Roles
Metro Automation Engine playbooks and roles fall into the following categories:

Playbook/Role | Description |
------------- | ----------- |
Predeploy | prepares infrastructure with necessary packages and makes the component(s) reachable |
Deploy | installs and configures component(s) |
Postdeploy | performs integration checks, and some basic commissioning tests |
Health | checks health for a running component without assuming it was deployed with Metro Automation Engine |
Destroy | removes component(s) from the infrastructure |
Upgrade | upgrades component(s) from one release to another |

## Nomenclature  
**Ansible Host**: The host where Metro Automation Engine runs. Ansible and the required packages are installed on this host. The Ansible Host must run el7 Linux host, e.g. Cent)S 7.* or RHEL 7.*.  
**Metro Automation Engine User**: The user who runs Metro Automation Engine to deploy and upgrade components.  
**Target Server**: The hypervisor on which one or more VSP components are installed as VMs. Each deployment may contain more than one Target Server.  

## Main Steps for Using Metro Automation Engine

1. [Setup](Documentation/SETUP.md) the Ansible Host.

2. [Customize](Documentation/CUSTOMIZE.md) variable files to match your network topology, and describe your NuageNetworks deployment specifics.

3. [Deploy](Documentation/DEPLOY.md) the new components, [upgrade](Documentation/UPGRADE.md) existing components, or run a health check on your system.

4. If things did not work out as expected, [destroy](Documentation/DESTROY.md) your environment.
