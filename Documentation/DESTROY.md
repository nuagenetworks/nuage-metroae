# Removing Nuage Networks Components with Metro Automation Engine

The main steps for removing a deployment are:  

[1. Check existing configuration](#1-check-existing-configuration)  
[2. Remove components](#2-remove-components)  

## Prerequisites / Requirements

Use this procedure when you have previously deployed VSP components and would like to remove all or some of the components and start over.  

## 1. Check Existing Configuration

If you have previously deployed components with Metro Automation Engine and your configuration has not changed, you may proceed to step **2. Remove Component(s)**.  

If you have not previously deployed components with Metro Automation Engine or your configuration has changed since, you will need to update your `build_vars.yml` file to reflect the new configuration.

## 2. Remove Components

You have the option of removing the entire deployment or only specified individual components.

### Remove All Components

Remove the entire existing deployment with one command as follows:  

```
./metro-ansible destroy_everything
```

Note: you may alternate between `install_everything` and `destroy_everything` as needed.  

### Remove Individual Components  

Alternatively, you can remove individual components (VSD, VSC, VRS, etc) as needed. See VSC example below for details.  

  #### Example Sequence for VSC:
  Configure `build_vars.yml`  
  Run `./metro-ansible install_everything` to deploy VSD, VSC, VRS, etc.  
  Discover that something needs to be changed in the VSCs  
  Run **`./metro-ansible vsc_destroy`** to tear down just the VSCs  
  Edit `build_vars.yml` to fix the problem  
  Run `./metro-ansible vsc_predeploy`, `./metro-ansible vsc_deploy`, and `./metro-ansible vsc_postdeploy` to get the VSCs up and running again.
