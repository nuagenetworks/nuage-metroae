# Deploying Nuage Networks Components in OpenStack with Metro Automation Engine (limited support)
## Internal Lab Use Only. Not for Customer Use.
The following components/roles are supported by Metro Automation Engine in OpenStack.
### Deploy Infra VM
You can deploy an infra VM that acts as a private DNS server and NTP server for VSD and VSC.
`vsd-deploy` role and `vsc-deploy` role automatically populate their respective DNS entries with the hostname and IP addr mappings.
### Deploy VSD (Standalone or HA)
To deploy VSD in OpenStack you must upload VSD qcow2 image to glance. You must also create network and a flavor that is inline with the VSD resource requirements. (refer to VSP Install Guide).
### Deploy VSC (Single or pair without BGP support)
To deploy VSC in OpenStack you must upload VSC qcow2 image to glance. You must also create mgmt, control networks and a flavor that is inline with VSC resource requirements. (refer to VSP Install Guide).
### Deploy VSTAT (Standalone)
To deploy VSTAT (Elastic Search VM) you must upload VSTAT qcow2 image to glance. You must also create network and a flavor that is inline with VSTAT resource requirements (refer to VSP Install Guide).
### OSC (one)
You can deploy OpenStack Controller (OSC) using packstack with `osc-predeploy` and `osc-deploy` roles. You must upload a cloud image (CentOS/RHEL 7 only) with cloud-init support to glance. Supply the network, flavor and OpenStack release string as well. You may deploy the OpenStack plugin from a tar-gz archive. You may automatically unzip the archive with the nuage_unzip.yml playbook by defining `nuage_zipped_files_dir` and `nuage_unzipped_files_dir` in `build_vars.yml`, then running `./metro-ansible nuage_unzip.yml`.
### Deploy OSC Computes (One or more) and Add Them to OSC with VRS Packages
You can deploy compute VMs that will be managed by OSC with `os-compute-predeploy` and `os-compute-deploy` roles. `os-compute-postdeploy` role will replace the OVS packages in these compute VMs with Nuage VRS packages. The user requirements are the same as for OSC.
### VRS and OpenStack Compute Nodes Integration
Integrating VRS with OpenStack Compute nodes requires user to provide information (ip addresses) of compute nodes. VRS will be deployed onto these nodes, by replacing OVS packages. A sample yml file can be found in [examples](../examples/build_vars.yml.VRSOnly). Following are the steps to be followed in the same order for successful integration

1. Edit build_vars.yml according to [examples](../examples/build_vars.yml.VRSOnly)
2. Run ./metro-ansible nuage_unzip.yml -vvv
3. Run ./metro-ansible build.yml -vvv
4. Run ./metro-ansible vrs_predeploy.yml -vvv
5. Run ./metro-ansible vrs_deploy.yml -vvv
6. Finally run ./metro-ansible vrs_oscompute_integration.yml -vvv
## VSD-OSC Integration
`vsd-osc-integration` role helps to integrate OpenStackController(OSC) with VSD by making necessary changes to horizon, nova and neutron plugin files on OSC. This role can be run individually provided, OSC and VSD are installed by user. Prior to running this role/playbook, user needs to provide information related to e.g. openstack release, nuage openstack plugins dir, etc. A sample yml file can be found in [examples](../examples/build_vars.yml.vsd_osc_integration). A sample workflow for vsd-osc integration is defined below.

1. Edit build_vars.yml according to [examples](../examples/build_vars.yml.vsd_osc_integration)
2. Provide vsd login info in uesr_creds.yml
3. Run ./metro-ansible nuage_unzip.yml -vvv
4. Run ./metro-ansible build.yml -vvv
5. Finally run ./metro-ansible vsd_osc_integration.yml -vvv

### Snapshots and Backup
`os-snapshot` role is used to make backups of an entire project or set of VMs in a project. These snapshots are downloaded to local machine. Currently they are not archived or exported to a remote machine. So, make sure the local machine has enough storage.

For details about build and nuage-unzip roles and how to execute them please refer to [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) file.
### Running playbooks
Refer to [README.md](/README.md) for the organization of playbooks.
All the above roles/components can be run individually with `./metro-ansible <playbook>.yml` command.
