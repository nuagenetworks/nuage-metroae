### Resolved Issues
* user-related fixes  
   - vsd-predeploy role tries to use the password listed in user_creds.yml to authenticate in the vmware_vm_shell tasks, rather than root/Alcateldc, which it should be using for a freshly-deployed OVF.
   - roles/vstat-vsd-health/tasks/main.yml: Needs remote_user: "{{ vstat_username }}" on the monit_waitfor_service task, otherwise it tries to SSH into vstat using the local username on the metro host, not the root user.
   - roles/vstat-health/tasks/main.yml: Needs delegate to localhost.
   - roles/vsc-backup/vars/main.yml: All the scp command lines refer to vsc_user - it should be vsc_username.
