# Setting Up the Nuage MetroAG Ansible Environment
(4 minute read)  

## Prerequisites / Requirements  
Before working with MetroAG, please read [README.md](/README.md) for a list of supported VCS/VNS components, supported target server types, and other requirements. 

## Main steps for setting up the environment  
[1. Clone Nuage MetroAG repository](#1-clone-nuage-metroag-repository)  
[2. Set up Ansible host](#2-set-up-ansible-host)  
[3. Enable SSH Access](#3-enable-ssh-access)  
[4. Install ovftool (for VMware only)](#4-install-ovftool-for-vmware-only)  

### 1. Clone Nuage MetroAG Repository
The Ansible Host must run el7 Linux host (CentOS 7.* or RHEL 7.*). Using one of the following two methods install a copy of the Nuage MetroAG repository onto the Ansible Host. 
#### Method One  
Download a zip of the Nuage MetroAG archive from [GitHub.com](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/nuage-metro), and install it onto the Ansible Host.

#### Method Two  
On the Ansible Host, execute the following commands:  
```
yum install -y git
git clone https://github.com/nuagenetworks/nuage-metro
```
### 2. Set Up Ansible Host
Prior to running MetroAG, use one of the two methods below to install the required packages onto the Ansible Host.

#### Method One: Set Up Ansible Host Automatically (recommended)
*metro-setup.sh* is a script provided with the MetroAG code, which installs the packages and modules required for MetroAG. If any of the packages or modules are already present, the script does not upgrade or overwrite them. The script can also be run multiple times without affecting the system. The sample below is an example and may not reflect the most recent software.
```
[JohnDoe@metroag-host ~]$ sudo ./metro-setup.sh
[sudo] password for JohnDoe:

Checking OS version... [ OK ]
Installing epel-release... [ OK ]

Installing vspk... [ OK ]
Installing pyvmomi... [ OK ]

Setup complete!
```
The script writes a detailed log into *metro-setup.log*.

#### Method Two: Set Up Ansible Host Manually
1. Install the following packages and modules for all setups:

Package or Module | Command   
------- | --------  
Epel-release | `yum install -y epel-release`  
Python-devel | `yum install -y python-devel.x86_64`  
Openssl-devel | `yum install -y openssl-devel`  
Python pip | `yum install -y python2-pip `  
Development Tools | `yum install -y "@Development tools"`  
Ansible 2.4 (for full support) | `pip install ansible==2.4`  
Netmiko and its dependencies | `pip install netmiko`  
Netaddr and its dependencies | `pip install netaddr`  
IPaddress and its dependencies | `pip install ipaddress`  
Python pexpect module | `pip install pexpect`  
VSPK Python module | `pip install vspk`  
Paramiko | `pip install paramiko==2.2.1`

2. **For ESXi / vCenter Only**, install the following package:  
 Note: vCenter deployments are supported for Nuage software version 4.0R7 and greater.  

Package | Command  
 -----| ------  
 pyvmomi | `pip install pyvmomi`  


3. For **OpenStack Only**, install the following module:

Module | Command  
 -----| ------  
 shade python | `pip install shade`

### 3. Enable SSH Access  
To enable passwordless SSH access, public/private SSH keys must be created and distributed for the MetroAG User and root users. The MetroAG User must be the root user or have *sudo* privileges.  
#### For MetroAG User
1. Login to the Ansible Host as the MetroAG User.  
2. Generate SSH keys.  
   Execute the command: `ssh-keygen`.  
3. Follow the prompts. It is normal to accept all defaults.  
4. Copy the SSH public key to the MetroAG User's authorized keys file.  
   Execute the command: `ssh-copy-id localhost`.  
#### For Root User  
1. Login to the Ansible Host as the Root User.  
2. Generate SSH keys.  
   Execute the command: `ssh-keygen`.  
3. Follow the prompts. It is normal to accept all defaults.  
4. Copy the SSH public key to the Root User's authorized keys file.  
   Execute the command: `ssh-copy-id root@localhost`.   
#### For Target Servers
1. Copy the SSH public key to the Target Server's authorized keys file.   
   Execute the command: `ssh-copy-id root@<target_server>`. Replace `<target_server>` with the actual IP address.  
2. Repeat for every target server.
   
### 4. Install ovftool (for VMware only)
 If you are installing VSP components in a VMware environment (ESXi/vCenter) you will also need to download and install the [ovftool](https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/ovf/) from VMware. MetroAG uses ovftool for OVA operations.

## Next Steps
The next step is to customize the MetroAG environment. See the applicable documentation below.
