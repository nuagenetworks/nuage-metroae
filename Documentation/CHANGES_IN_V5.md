# Changes in V5
We have Made the following changes to MetroAE in v5 as compared to previous versions of MetroAE. All changes are summarised in this document.

## MetroAE operation changes
In v4 and before, MetroAE shipped with 2 modes of operation. The container and git clone. With the new release, we have made things a bit easier for the users. There is a single mode of operation - a new MetroAE container. This will replace the old MetroAE container, which will no longer be supported.

This new container will be dynamically built on the users machine. Users will need to get the latest MetroAE repository on their machine. The only other pre-requisite for the user is to have docker installed on their MetroAE Host Machine. The changes for moving from v4 to v5 are as below depending on type of installation.

### Moving from MetroAE git clone/download to MetroAE v5
1. Download or git pull the latest MetroAE code
2. Make sure docker is installed and running. The `docker ps` command can verify this.
3. Use `./metroae-container` instead of `./metroae`. All other arguments remain the same.
   e.g. Instead of this initial command
   `./metroae install vsds -vvv` use `./metroae-container install vsds -vvv`
   Another example for deployments other than defaults
   `./metroae install vsds specialdeployment -vvv` use `./metroae-container install vsds specialdeployment -vvv`
4. Users can now specify file locations relative to the MetroAE container using `./` instead of `/metroae`. Here `/metroae` refers to the present working directory for the user. 
   e.g.
   `nuage_unzipped_files_dir: ./images/20.10.R4` automatically changes to `nuage_unzipped_files_dir: /metroae/images/20.10.R4`
5. All the specified paths for licenses, unzipped files, backup directories should be inside the MetroAE repository. e.g. you cannot specify `/opt` or `/tmp` for the MetroAE host. If your mount directory for images is outside the MetroAE folder, you can use a mount bind to put them inside the MetroAE directory.
   e.g.
   `sudo mount --bind -o ro /mnt/nfs-data /<your-repo-location>/images`
6. Users do not need to run setup at all, all dependencies will be automatically taken care of with the new container in the background.
7. For vcenter users only, MetroAE should be cloned or downloaded in a directory where ovftool is present. The entire vmware-ovftool folder must be present. In short, the path to ovftool should be somewhere inside the MetroAE top level folder. You can mount bind the ovftool to the metro repo location.
   `sudo mount --bind -o ro /usr/lib/vmware-ovftool /<your-repo-location>/ovftool`

### Moving from MetroAE v4 container/download to MetroAE v5
1. Download or git pull the latest MetroAE code
2. Destroy the old container using `./metroae-container destroy` command
3. Use `./metroae-container` instead of `/metroae`. All other arguments remain the same.
   e.g. Instead of this initial command
   `metroae install vsds -vvv` use `./metroae-container install vsds -vvv`
   Another example for deployments other than defaults
   `metroae install vsds specialdeployment -vvv` use `./metroae-container install vsds specialdeployment -vvv`
4. For all image paths, make sure they start with `/metroae` instead of `/metroae_data`. Here `/metroae` refers to the present working directory for the user.
   e.g.
   `nuage_unzipped_files_dir: /metroae_data/images/20.10.R4` changes to `nuage_unzipped_files_dir: /metroae/images/20.10.R4`
5. You can create an `images` folder in `nuage-metroae` and move the `/metroae_data` mount folder under `/<your-repo-location>/images` athat way you can replace `/metroae_data` with `/metroae_data/images` in the deployment files.

## Ansible and Python Changes
MetroAE is now supported with Ansible version 3.4.0 and higher. Python3 is now required. Do not worry, the container that gets dynamically created should take care of the python, ansible and any other dependencies that are needed. This will not affect the user environment as all dependencies will be installed in the MetroAE container.

## MetroAE Config
MetroaAE Config is no longer bundled with MetroAE. Please refer to https://github.com/nuagenetworks/nuage-metroae-config to get information on how use MetroAE Config.
