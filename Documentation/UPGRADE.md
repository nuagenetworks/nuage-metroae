## Sample HA Metro workflow for an upgrade

For the purposes of this sample, an HA deployment is one that consists 3 VSD nodes in a cluster, two VSC nodes, a single VSTAT node, and a number of deployed VRS instances. Nuage-Metro supports upgrades to both HA and SA deployments as well as 3-node VSTAT clusters on KVM and VMware. This document will describe the specific procedure for the upgrade of an HA deployment defined above. Slight modifications to this procedure will enable Metro to support other possible upgrades, e.g. one VSD, one VSC, one VSTAT.

1. Run a pre-upgrade health checks on the platform

```
./metro-ansible vsp_preupgrade_health -vvvv
```

The health reports and any reported error should carefully be checked before proceeding with the next steps.
These health checks can be run at any time of the upgrade process.

2. Database Backup and decouple the VSD cluster

```
./metro-ansible vsd_ha_upgrade_database_backup_and_decouple -vvvv
```

At this point, vsd_node1 has been decoupled from the cluster and is running in SA mode. If you experience a failure in the previous step, recovery depends on the state of vsd_node1. If itâ€™s still in the cluster, you can simply retry. If not, you will need to redeploy vsd_node1 from a backup (user is expected to have the vm backup ready before the upgrade procedure) or otherwise recover.

3. Power off vsd_node2 and vsd_node3

```
./metro-ansible vsd_ha_upgrade_shutdown_2_and_3 -vvvv
```

At this point, vsd_node2 and vsd_node3 are shut down, but not deleted. The new nodes will be brought up with new VM names. Note that this step may be done manually if the user chooses. If you experience a failure running the Metro command for this step, a retry is advised. Or you can power off the VMs manually.

4. Predeploy new vsd_node2 and vsd_node3

```
./metro-ansible vsd_ha_upgrade_predeploy_2_and_3 -vvvv
```

At this point, the new vsd_node2 and vsd_node3 are up and running, but they have not yet been configured. If you experience a failure in this step, execute the command vsd_ha_upgrade_destroy_2_and_3 to delete the new nodes. Then retry the step.

5. Deploy new vsd_node2 and vsd_node3

```
./metro-ansible vsd_ha_upgrade_deploy_2_and_3 -vvvv
```

At this point, two VSD nodes have been upgraded. If you experience a failure before the VSD install script runs, retry command vsd_ha_upgrade_deploy_2_and_3. If that fails again or the failure comes after the VSD install script runs, destroy the VMs manually or use vsd_ha_upgrade_destroy_2_and_3, then retry starting at step 5.

6. Power off vsd_node1

```
./metro-ansible vsd_ha_upgrade_shutdown_1 -vvvv
```

At this point, vsd_node1 is shut down, but not deleted. The new node will be brought up with a new VM name. Note that this step may be done manually if the user chooses. If you experience a failure running the Metro command for this step, a retry is advised. Or you can power off the VM manually.

7. Run predeploy on vsd_node1

```
./metro-ansible vsd_ha_upgrade_predeploy_1 -vvvv
```

At this point, the new vsd_node1 is up and running, but it has not yet been configured. If you experience a failure in this step, execute the command vsd_ha_upgrade_destroy_1 to delete the new node. Then retry the step.

8. Run deploy on vsd_node1

```
./metro-ansible vsd_ha_upgrade_deploy_1 -vvvv
```

At this point, all 3 VSD nodes have been upgraded. If you experience a failure before the VSD install script runs, retry command vsd_ha_upgrade_deploy_1. If that fails again or the failure comes after the VSD install script runs, destroy the VMs manually or use vsd_ha_upgrade_destroy_1, then retry starting at step 8.

9. Set the VSD upgrade complete flag

```
./metro-ansible vsd_upgrade_complete -vvvv
```

After all the VSDs are upgraded, this step sets the upgrade flag to complete. It can be re-run in case of failure. It would be good time to login to VSD and verify the new version.

10. Run VSC health checks

```
./metro-ansible vsc_health -e report_filename=vsc_preupgrade_health.txt -vvvv
```

This step is already done in step 2. You can skip it here if you wish. It is good practice to re-run at this point in order to inspect the report to make sure the VSD upgrade work has not caused problems.

11.  Run VSC backup and prep on vsc_node1

```
./metro-ansible vsc_ha_upgrade_backup_and_prep_1 -vvvv
```

If this fails, retry.

12. Run VSC deploy on vsc_node1

```
./metro-ansible vsc_ha_upgrade_deploy_1 -vvvv
```

If the step fails, you can retry. If a retry fails, rollback is accomplished by manually copying (via scp) the .tim file, bof.cfg, and config.cfg that were backed up in step 11 to the VSC. Then reboot the VSC.

13. Run VSC postdeploy on vsc_node1

```
./metro-ansible vsc_ha_upgrade_postdeploy_1 -vvvv
```

At this point, you have one VSC running the old version, one running the new. It is time for you to leave this procedure to execute an upgrade of your VRSs, NSGs, and so on.

If the step fails, you can retry. If a retry fails, rollback is accomplished by manually copying (via scp) the .tim file, bof.cfg, and config.cfg that were backed up in step 11 to the VSC. Then reboot the VSC.

*Upgrade VRS here!*

14.  Run VSC backup and prep on vsc_node2

```
./metro-ansible vsc_ha_upgrade_backup_and_prep_2 -vvvv
```

If this fails, retry.

15. Run VSC deploy on vsc_node2

```
./metro-ansible vsc_ha_upgrade_deploy_2 -vvvv
```

If the step fails, you can retry. If a retry fails, rollback is accomplished by manually copying (via scp) the .tim file, bof.cfg, and config.cfg that were backed up in step 14 to the VSC. Then reboot the VSC.

16. Run VSC postdeploy on vsc_node2

```
./metro-ansible vsc_ha_upgrade_postdeploy_2 -vvvv
```

At this point, you have both VSCs running the new version. It is time for you to upgrade the final VSD.

If the step fails, you can retry. If a retry fails, rollback is accomplished by manually copying (via scp) the .tim file, bof.cfg, and config.cfg that were backed up in step 14 to the VSC. Then reboot the VSC.


*If VSTAT nodes exist upgrade them using following procedure, if not skip to step 23 to finalize VSP upgrade*

17. Run VSTAT health checks

```
./metro-ansible vstat_health -e report_filename=vstat_preupgrade_health.txt -vvvv
```

This step is already done in step 2. You can skip it here if you wish. It is good practice to re-run at this point in orfder to inspect the report to make sure the VSD upgrade work has not caused problems.

18. Run vstat_upgrade_data_backup

```
./metro-ansible vstat_upgrade_data_backup -vvvv
```

At this point the data from the vstat nodes is backed in the NFS shared folder. If you experience a failure in the previous step, you can simply retry.

19. Power off all vstats

```
./metro-ansible vstat_destroy -vvvv
```

At this point, all vstat nodes are shut down, but not deleted. The new nodes will be brought up with new VM names. Note that this step may be done manually if the user chooses. If you experience a failure running the Metro command for this step, a retry is advised. Or you can power off the VMs manually.

20. Predeploy new vstat nodes

```
./metro-ansible vstat_predeploy -vvvv
```

At this point, the new vstat nodes are up and running, but they have not yet been configured. If you experience a failure in this step, execute the command vstat_upgrade_destroy to delete the new nodes. Then retry the step.

21. Deploy new vstat nodes

```
./metro-ansible vstat_deploy -vvvv
```

At this point, new vstat nodes have been deployed and configured to talk with VSD(s). If you experience a failure, retry command vstat_deploy. If that fails again, destroy the VMs manually or use vstat_upgrade_destroy, then retry starting at step 20.

22. Run vstat_upgrade_data_migrate

```
./metro-ansible vstat_upgrade_data_migrate -vvvv
```

At this point the data from the old vstat nodes is migrated to the new VSTAT nodes from the NFS shared folder. If you experience a failure in the previous step, you can simply retry.


23. Run VSP upgrade postdeploy to finalize settings

```
./metro-ansible vsp_upgrade_postdeploy -vvvv
```

This will execute the final steps of the upgrade. It can be rerun if there is a failure.

24. Run VSP post-upgrade heath

```
./metro-ansible vsp_postupgrade_health -vvvv
```

Writes out new health reports that can be compared to those produced in step one. Any errors or discrepancies should be investigated carefully.


## Sample Metro workflow for standalone upgrade

For the purpose of this sample, a Standalone deployment is one that consists exactly one VSD node, one VSC node, a single VSTAT node, and a number of deployed VRS instances. Note that if you have 2 VSCs, after the VSD upgrade is complete, follow the VSC upgrade instructions from the HA procedure, above.

1. Run health checks on VSD,VSC and VSTAT

```
./metro-ansible vsp_preupgrade_health -vvvv
```

The health reports and any reported error should carefully be checked before proceeding with the next steps.

These health checks can be run at any time of the upgrade process.

2. Databse Backup of standalone VSD

```
./metro-ansible vsd_sa_upgrade_database_backup -vvvv
```

At this point, vsd node database backup is completed. If you experience a failure in the previous step, you can simply retry.

3. Power off vsd

```
./metro-ansible vsd_sa_upgrade_shutdown -vvvv
```

At this point, vsd is shut down, but not deleted. The new node will be brought up with new VM name. Note that this step may be done manually if the user chooses. If you experience a failure running the Metro command for this step, a retry is advised. Or you can power off the VM manually.

4. Predeploy new vsd node

```
./metro-ansible vsd_predeploy -vvvv
```

At this point, the new vsd node is up and running, but it has not yet been configured. If you experience a failure in this step, execute the command vsd_sa_upgrade_destroy to delete the new node. Then retry the step.

5. Deploy new vsd node

```
./metro-ansible vsd_sa_upgrade_deploy -vvvv
```

At this point, VSD node is upgraded. If you experience a failure before the VSD install script runs, retry command vsd_sa_upgrade_deploy. If that fails again or the failure comes after the VSD install script runs, destroy the VMs manually or use vsd_destroy, then retry starting at step 5.

6. Set the VSD upgrade complete flag

```
./metro-ansible vsd_upgrade_complete -vvvv
```

After all the VSDs are upgraded, this step sets the upgrade flag to complete. It can be re-run in case of failure. It would be good time to login to VSD and v
erify the new version.

7. Run VSC health checks

```
./metro-ansible vsc_health -e report_filename=vsc_preupgrade_health.txt -vvvv
```

This step is already done in step 2. You can skip it here if you wish. It is good practice to re-run at this point in order to inspect the report to make sure the VSD upgrade work has not caused problems.

8.  Run VSC backup and prep on vsc

```
./metro-ansible vsc_sa_upgrade_backup_and_prep -vvvv
```

9. Run VSC deploy on vsc

```
./metro-ansible vsc_sa_upgrade_deploy -vvvv
```

If the step fails, you can retry. Backup plan is to manually copy a valid .tim file to the VSC to affect the deployment. If that fails, you will need to deploy a new VSC using the old version--or recover the VM from a backup. You can use Metro for the deployment (vsc_predeploy, vsc_deploy, vsc_postdeploy...).

10. Run VSC postdeploy on vsc

```
./metro-ansible vsc_sa_upgrade_postdeploy -vvvv
```

At this point, you have VSC upgrade is complete.

If this step fails, the recovery is much like that of the previous step: Manually update the tim file or a complete deploy of the old VSC followed by a retry.

*Upgrade VRS here!*

*If VSTAT node exist upgrade it using steps 17-22 in HA upgrade workflow mentioned in above section, if not skip to step 11 to finalize VSP upgrade*

11. Run VSP upgrade postdeploy to finalize settings

```
./metro-ansible vsp_upgrade_postdeploy -vvvv
```

This will execute the final steps of the upgrade. It can be rerun if there is a failure.

12. Run VSP post-upgrade heath

```
./metro-ansible vsp_postupgrade_health -vvvv
```

Writes out new health reports that can be compared to those produced in step one. Any errors or discrepancies should be investigated carefully.
