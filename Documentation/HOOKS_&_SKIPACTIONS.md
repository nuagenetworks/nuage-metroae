# Hooks and Skip Actions
MetroAE allows fine-grained control of operations via its hierarchical design. You have the option to execute workflows such as `install_everything` when you just want the simplicity of allowing MetroAE to handle the details. In some situations, however, you may want to take advantage of fine-grained control such as individually executing the workflows `vsd_predeploy`, `vsd_deploy`, and `vsd_postdeploy`.

One of the reasons to take advantage of fine-grained control is so that you can execute your own scripts for verification and configuration between MetroAE's steps. Another is so that you can skip a workflow entirely, using your own tooling to bring up the VSD VM instead of using `vsd_predeploy`, for example. Hooks have been added to simplify and automate the former. Skips have been added to simplify and automate the latter.

## Hooks
Hooks are predefined locations that preceed specific MetroAE worflows. They can be thought of as places in the code where MetroAE can execute commands on your behalf. These commands can be any executable available on the Ansible host. If the command is a script, it has access to the full range of MetroAE's Ansible variable, e.g. `echo {{ hostvars[inventory_hostname].name }}`. As you can see, your script should use standard Ansible Jinja2 variable syntax. Each predefined location comes immediately before selected low-level MetroAE workflows. Defining a command or script to run at a specific location means that the command or script will run before the workflow is executed.

### Hooks File
A Hooks file is a YAML file that contains the name of the MetroAE workflow that is the location of the hook and the command or script that will be executed before the workflow is executed. The path to a Hooks file is specified in the optional `hooks` section of the deployment file for the component being operated on, e.g. `vsds.yml`. If more than one command needs to be run at a specific location, multiple Hooks files must be created, each specifying the same location and a unique command. When creating multiple files for the same location MetroAE does not guarantee the execution of the files in the order defined in the deployment file. If order matters the best practice is to create a wrapper script that calls the commands in the preferred order. If any one command execution fails, the MetroAE workflow will fail with an error.

Here is an example of a Hooks file that specifies a script to execute prior to running the `vstat_predeploy` workflow:
```
location: vstat_predeploy
command: "/tmp/myfiles/myscript.sh"
```

### Workflow Hook Locations

```

## Skip Actions
A Skip Action is invoked when you want a particular workflow to be skipped. For example, defining `vsd_predeploy` in the skip actions list for a component will cause MetroAE to skip this workflow even when running a workflow that encapsulates it, e.g. `install_vsds`. In such a case, running `install_everything` or `install_vsds` will skip the `vsd_predeploy` workflow. Skip actions need to specified in common.yml file. skip actions in common.yml takes a list. Example of skip_actions

```
skip_actions:
  - vsd_predeploy
  - vstat_predeploy
```

Note: In the current release, Skip Actions are supported for the following workflows:
```
vsd_predeploy
vsc_predeploy
vstat_predeploy
nsgv_predeploy
vnsutil_predeploy
vrs_predeploy
```
