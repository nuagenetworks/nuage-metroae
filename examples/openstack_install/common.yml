# Common Configuration Settings
#
# Common configuration settings for this deployment
#
# Automatically generated by script.
#

##### Paths and Domains

# < Nuage Unzip Files Directory >
# Full path to the directory where the Nuage unzipped files for this deployment can be found  E.g. qcow2 files. When using docker container the path needs to be a relative path from the images path specified during setup.
#
nuage_unzipped_files_dir: "/my/unzipped/filedir"

# < Nuage Software Version >
# Nuage software version being installed. Optional for version comparison to skip deployment of some components that have already been installed.
#
# nuage_software_version: ""

# < Domain Name >
# Domain name for this deployment. E.g. company.net.
#
dns_domain: "company.com"

# < Reports Directory >
# Full path to the directory where the generated health reports for this deployment will be placed
#
# metro_reports_dir: ./reports

# < Branding Zip File >
# Enables custom branding for the VSD GUI. When not defined, the default VSD branding, already present on the VSD itself, will be used. If branding_zip_file is defined, its value will be used to replace the default VSD branding with the contents of a zip file on the Ansible host.  The files contained in the zip file should conform to the specifications of the VNS install guide. For replacing the default branding on the VSD, this value should be set to one of the following values: 1) The path to a branding zip file on the Ansible host 2) The special value 'nuage' for adding a MetroAE tag to the default VSD branding. This value is provided as an example of a minimal modification of branding. 3) The special value 'metroae' to replace the default VSD branding with a complete MetroAE-themed brand. This value is provided as an example of a complete replacement of all branding components. Note that when this is defined the existing branding will be backed up to the directory specified by the Metro Backup Root variable under (hostname)-branding/. To rollback a branding change, copy the branding zip file out of the backup directory, set this variable to the path to the copied backup file, and run the brand_vsd playbook, i.e. metroae brand_vsd.
