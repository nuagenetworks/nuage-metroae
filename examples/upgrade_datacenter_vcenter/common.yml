#
# user_ssh_pub_key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

# < XMPP TLS >
# Flag to indicate when secure communications via TLS will be used between VSCs and VSDs
#
# xmpp_tls: True

# < OpenFlow TLS >
# Flag to indicate when secure communications via TLS will be used between VSCs and data plane components, e.g. VRS or NSGv; If VRS is defined, target_server_password must be defined in credentials.yml
#
# openflow_tls: True

# < Reports Directory >
# Full path to the directory where the generated health reports for this deployment will be placed
#
# metro_reports_dir: ./reports

# < VSD License Required Days Left >
# Raise a failure if the VSD licenses do not have at least the specified number of days remaining before expiration. If undefined, no check of days remaining before license expiration will be made. If you want to verify that the number of days left before expiration is more than a certain number of days, uncomment this variable and set the value to the number of days.
#
# vsd_license_required_days_left: -1

# < VSD License Filename >
# Filename for the license file for the VSD.  Currently only used for NSGv Bootstrapping
#
# vsd_license_file: ""

# < Branding Zip File >
# Enables custom branding for the VSD GUI. When not defined, the default VSD branding, already present on the VSD itself, will be used. If branding_zip_file is defined, its value will be used to replace the default VSD branding with the contents of a zip file on the Ansible host.  The files contained in the zip file should conform to the specifications of the VNS install guide. For replacing the default branding on the VSD, this value should be set to one of the following values: 1) The path to a branding zip file on the Ansible host 2) The special value 'nuage' for adding a MetroÆ tag to the default VSD branding. This value is provided as an example of a minimal modification of branding. 3) The special value 'metroae' to replace the default VSD branding with a complete MetroÆ-themed brand. This value is provided as an example of a complete replacement of all branding components. Note that when this is defined the existing branding will be backed up to the directory specified by the Metro Backup Root variable under (hostname)-branding/. To rollback a branding change, copy the branding zip file out of the backup directory, set this variable to the path to the copied backup file, and run the brand_vsd playbook, i.e. metroae brand_vsd.
