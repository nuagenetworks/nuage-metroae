# Hypervisor network bridges
# Network bridges required on the target server (hypervisor) for VM deployment.
# On KVM, the bridges must exist as specified. The VSD needs mgmt_bridge. The
# VSC needs mgmt_bridge and data_bridge. nsgv requires the access_bridge. On
# vcenter, mgmt_bridge specifies the portgroup in vCenter to which the
# management interfaces need to be connected to, and data_bridge specifies the
# portgroup in vCenter to which the data interfaces need to be connected to.
# In vCenter/ESXi, you have virtual switches and portgroups. A virtual switch
# is similar to a normal switch, a network separation object. VMs on different
# vSwitches can not communicate directly with each other, they have to leave
# the host through the physical uplinks of the vSwitch, up to the physical
# network, to connect to each other (if the physical network is configured
# correctly). A portgroup is a sub section of a vSwitch that groups ports, this
# group of ports have the same configuration (for instance, the same VLAN, same
# security settings, …). A port can only be part of one portgroup, a VM can of
# course have multiple interfaces on multiple portgroups (and a vm can have
# interfaces on portgroups that are on different vSwitches as well).
# Note that these are global network settings. Depending on the usecase, these
# variables can be defined in the specific components (myvsds, myvscs etc). If
# defined, they will overwrite the global settings.

# Vcenter params
#
# Used *only* when deploying on a Vmware environment. Can be ignored when
# deploying on KVM hypervisors.
#
# username
# The vCenter user with proper permissions to deploy an OVA on the specified
# cluster (at least: create VM, configure VM, boot VM, Allocate disk space,
# connect networks. There might be other permissions required)
#
# password
# The password with which to connect to vCenter, matching the user specified in
# the username field
#
# datacenter
# The vCenter datacenter in which the cluster is located, a Datacenter is the
# first level of objects beneath the root vCenter object
#
# cluster
# The vCenter cluster where the VMs need to be deployed in. A cluster is a
# grouping of ESXi hosts with more or less the same purpose. In a typical
# datacenter deployment, you will see a management cluster, a grouping of ESXi
# hosts where all management components run (for instance vCenter, Active
# Directory, DNS/NTP servers, …); and one or more compute or customer clusters,
# a grouping of ESXi hosts with the purpose of handling non-management VMs
# (compute nodes)
#
# datastore
# The vCenter datastore where the VMs need to be located. A datastore is a set
# of disks (local storage), an NFS server or an iSCSI/FiberChannel  LUN which is
# exposed to one or more ESXi hosts. In case a datastore is specified to which
# only one ESXi host is connected (for instance in case of local storage), the
# VM that is being deployed, will only be able to run on that specific ESXi
# host. If the datastore is available on multiple ESXi hosts in the specified
# cluster (in case of shared storage like NFS, iSCSI or FC), when the VM is
# booted, vCenter will pick a host to boot the VM on (random, or based on the
# load of the cluster, depending on the cluster configuration). Datastores can
# be renamed… by default, if a local datastore is created on an ESXi host of
# the local disks, it get the name 'datastore', in case multiple ESXi hosts are
# added to vCenter and each has a local datastore called 'datastore', they will
# get a follow number ('datastore (1)', 'datastore (2)', …). It is recommended
# that you rename the local datastore from the default to the same name as the
# host it is from, that clearly identifies the local datastore of a specific
# ESXi host.  In case a datastore is shared (NFS, iSCSI, FC) on multiple hosts,
# it will only show up once in vCenter, but the hosts tab will show it is
# available on multiple hosts (view in the screenshot below)
