# Support for deploying VSP components in OpenStack through metro(limited support)
# Note: This is purely for internal lab. Not meant for customer use.

## Overview

Using metro, users can deploy VSP components into OpenStack. These are the following components/roles supported by metro on OpenStack.

1. Deploy Infra VM
2. Deploy VSD (Standalone or HA)
3. Deploy VSTAT (Standalone)
4. Deploy VSC (1 or in pair without BGP support)
5. Deploy OSC (1)
6. Deploy OSC Computes (1 or more) and add them to OSC with VRS packages
7. VSD-OSC intergaration
8. Create Snapshot of project or VMs

## Details

### Infra VM

An infra VM is deployed to act as private DNS server and ntp server for VSD and VSC. The DNS entries are automatically populated with the hostname and IP addr mappings of VSD and VSC with the help of vsd-deploy and vsc-deploy roles. For this reason the user has to specify the infra VM FQDN in VSD and VSC build-vars (see reference below).

### VSD 

Deloying VSD in OpenStack requires the user to upload VSD qcow2 image to glance. For this release, the user is also required to create network and create a flavor that is inline with VSD resource requirements (refer VSP install guide). Standalone or HA deployments are supported

### VSC

Deploying VSC in OpenStack requires the user to upload VSC qcow2 image to glance. For this release, the user is also required to create a mgmt, control networks and create a flavor that is inline with VSC resource requirements (refer VSP install guide). Single or Pair(without BGP config) of VSC deployment is supported.

### VSTAT (Elastic Search VM) 

Deloying VSTAT in OpenStack requires the user to upload VSTAT qcow2 image to glance. For this release, the user is also required to create network and create a flavor that is inline with VSTAT resource requirements (refer VSP install guide). Only standalone mode is tested and supported.

### OSC

`osc-predploy` and `osc-deploy` roles are used to deploy OpenStack Controller (OSC) using packstack. The user needs to upload a cloud image (only CentOS/RHEL 7 are supported) with cloud-init support to glance. The network, flavor and OpenStack release string needs to be supplied by user as well.
The user may be depoying the OpenStack plugin from a tar-gz archive. The archive may be automatically unzipped using the `nuage_unzip.yml` playbook. Define the `nuage_zipped_files_dir` and `nuage_unzipped_files_dir` in `build_vars.yml` and run `./metro-ansible nuage_unzip.yml`. 

### OSC Computes

`os-compute-predeploy` and `os-compute-deploy` roles are used in deploying compute vms that will be managed by OSC. `os-compute-postdeploy` role will replace the ovs packages in thesecompute vms with Nuage VRS packages. The user requirements are same as OSC.

### VSD-OSC intergration

`vsd-osc-config` role helps to integrate OSC with VSD by making necessary changes to horizon and nuetron plugin files. It will also add csproot user to CMS group on VSD.

### Snapshots and backup

`os-snapshot` roles is used to make backups of an entire project or set of VMs in a project. These snapshots are downloaded to local machine. Currently they are not archived or exported to a remote machine. So, make sure the local machine has enough storage.

For details about build and nuage-unzip roles and how to execute them please refer to `BUILD.md` file.

## Runnning playbooks

For playbook organization please refer to `playbook organization` section of `README.md`
All the above roles/components can be run individually with `./metro-ansible <playbook>.yml` command
